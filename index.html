            <p> Hello everyone! I'm <strong>Nhi</strong> (That pronounces a bit similar to "knee"). 
                I'm from <strong> Vietnam</strong>, and I'm studying <strong> CS </strong> - People and Intelligence 
                Currently, I just found myself in studying web. Therefore, I spent two weeks 
                of my Christmas break to start learning about it, and this is also my first time
                expose to develop a website. I'm looking forward to dive myself and widen my horizon about it. <strong> Additionally</strong>,
                my ambition is to apply my knowledge to make a good 
                impact on the society, especically in education.
            </p>
